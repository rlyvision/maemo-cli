# Introduction
maemo-cli is a command line client designed to make installation of maemo leste on all supported devices easier and more automated.
# Usage
use ``maemo select`` to select device <br>
use ``maemo install`` to install maemo leste to specified device
# Notes
Program isn't fully out yet, only droid 3 and droid 4 scripts are done and still needs testers. I will probably keep needing testers until (if) maemo leste sends units
